        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
           Owl is implied to be the one who originally killed Wolf during the events of the Hirata attack three years prior to the events of the game. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The first time Sekiro uses a shinobi prosthetic tool during the fight, Owl will comment on it, recognising it and implying he knew the previous owner, possibly from his time with the Sculptor and Dogen.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Owl’s real name is Ukonzaemon Usui.
        </p>

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>&#183; <strong>Zig-Zag:</strong> 
          Many of Owl’s attacks begin with a zig-zag movement intended to throw you off. After this feint, he may follow up with any of the following five moves.
        </p>

        <p>
          &#183; <strong>Shuriken Throw:</strong> 
          Owl begins by throwing two shuriken, then flips through the air toward you, finishing with a single downward sword strike.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Shadowfall:</strong> Similar to your Mushin Shadowfall Combat Art, Owl charges up for an unblockable thrust. If it connects, he leaps off and follows up with two powerful downward slashes.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Shuriken Slash:</strong> 
          Owl throws a shuriken at the player immediately followed by a running slash. Similar to the Chasing Slice Shinobi Martial Art
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Perilous Sweep:</strong> 
          Owl approaches from the side and unleashes an unblockable sweep—be sure to jump over it. He may follow up with one of the following moves.
        </p>
        
        <p>&#183; <strong>Large Overhead Slash:</strong> 
          Owl winds up for a powerful overhead slash. If you dodge to the side, he transitions into a spinning slash. If you dodge backward, he flips toward you and follows up with a slash.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Backflip:</strong> 
          Owl leaps off your body—this doesn't deal vitality damage, but it inflicts significant posture damage.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Firecrackers:</strong> 
          At times, he will toss black gunpowder that detonates similarly to the Shinobi Firecracker, dealing damage upon explosion.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Running Slash:</strong> 
          Owl charges at you with a single powerful slash. He may follow this up with one of the following two moves:
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>5-slash Firecracker Combo:</strong> 
          Owl unleashes three consecutive sword slashes, then strikes with his elbow, and immediately follows up by throwing firecrackers, which he cuts through with a final slash.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Double Slash into Perilous Sweep:</strong> 
          Owl delivers two quick sword slashes, finishing with a Perilous Sweep. He may follow this up with his powerful Overhead Slash.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Shuriken Slash:</strong> 
          Owl hurls a shuriken at the player, immediately followed by a running slash—reminiscent of the Chasing Slice Shinobi Martial Art.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Stomp (deathblow):</strong> 
          Owl lifts his foot high before stomping down, pinning the player to the ground and stabbing them through the chest. This attack deals massive damage, cannot be blocked, and has no Perilous indicator.

          He is likely to use this move after breaking the player’s posture if he is within close range.
        </p>


        <h3>Phase 2</h3>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Backflip + Shuriken</strong> 
          Same as in phase one but he throws shuriken after. 
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Owl Teleport: </strong> 
          Owl will use his summoned owl to teleport above you and drop down with a slash 
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Fire Owl + Shadowfall: </strong> 
          Owl will summon his owl to his hand and throw an unblockable fire owl projectile towards you, then follow up with Shadowfall. 
        </p>
