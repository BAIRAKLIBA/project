        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          Lady Butterfly and Sekiro (Wolf) share a history, as she acknowledges during their encounter by saying, *"It has been quite some time, son of Owl."* Upon obtaining her memory, it’s revealed that Owl once hired her to train Wolf, helping shape him into the skilled shinobi he is.

          Her combat style stands out among other bosses. It closely resembles that of the Ministry’s Lone Shadows, particularly in how she deflects attacks with her leg—just like the Lone Shadows do. At the same time, her movements bear similarities to the Temple style used by the monks of Senpou Temple, known for incorporating leg-based techniques, unlike the more traditional Ashina or Shinobi styles. However, she also employs classic Shinobi tools like shuriken, much like Owl himself. It's likely that her mentorship played a key role in Wolf’s ability to fluidly master and integrate four distinct combat styles.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>&#183; <strong>Kunai Throw:</strong> 
          All kunai attacks can be either blocked or deflected.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Jump into the Ragters:</strong> When Lady Butterfly leaps onto the rafters, you can use the Shuriken Prosthetic to knock her down and create a brief opening. To maximize your chances, deploy the Shuriken Prosthetic right as she begins her jump; otherwise, she will probably deflect the attack.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Prilious Attack-Above:</strong> As soon as the Perilous Attack kanji appears, quickly dodge or shift slightly to avoid the strike. Right after the attack, you'll have a brief opportunity to land a hit on Lady Butterfly. If timed correctly, you can also use the Shuriken Prosthetic to knock her out of the air, creating a short opening for an attack. 
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Prilious Attack-Sweep:</strong> 
          When the Perilous Attack kanji appears, jump and kick Lady Butterfly to deal significant posture damage. Her sweep attack has moderate range, so if you're nearby when the red kanji shows up, jump onto her head. If you're farther away, you can simply evade the attack without risk.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 2</h3>
        <p><strong>&#183; Illusions:</strong> If you have Snap Seeds, move to the center of the illusions and use one to dispel them. If not, try to defeat as many phantoms as possible—they also drop Spirit Emblems. You can stay near the edges of the room to avoid most of their slow attacks. When Lady Butterfly absorbs the illusions to unleash her spell, take cover behind a pillar to shield yourself from the attack.
