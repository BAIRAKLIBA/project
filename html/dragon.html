        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          The Divine Dragon continues the recurring theme of missing its left arm, just like Sekiro, Sculptor and the Demon of Hatred (on his main body, at least - he has a smaller pair of arms higher up on his neck). Being also called Dragon of the Everblossom suggests that the missing arm could be connected to the severed branch brought by Takeru from the Divine Realm - which became the Everblossom tree in the Ashina Castle and is later stolen by <a href="owl.html">Owl</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Old Dragons appear in two forms: sickly grey/white ones—matching the color of the Mark of Stagnation on Sekiro’s head—and healthy black ones. Defeating the healthy dragons does not reduce the boss’s health bar. In the first phase, the large tree looks withered and lifeless, but after the diseased dragons are slain, it begins to revive and flourish.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Old Dragons’ persistent hacking and coughing suggest they may be a physical embodiment of the spreading Dragonrot—wooden dragons that are quite literally rotting—or, at the very least, are heavily afflicted by it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dragon's serpentine design is typical of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dragon">Japanese dragons</a> tamatori being pursued by a japanese dragon  which are conventionally connected to water. It is not native to Japan but the amalgamated form of "naga" dragons in the Buddhism legends, "lóng" dragons in the Chinese mythology, and great-snakes in the native Japanese mythology. This design is consistent with the in-game description that the Divine Dragon is originated in the west.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>
          During the first phase, the player doesn’t battle the Divine Dragon directly but instead faces the Old Dragons of the Tree in a relatively straightforward encounter. 
        </p>

        <p>
          These enemies move very slowly and won’t rush toward the player. Avoid close contact, as they emit a poisonous gas when coughing. Wait for the trees to appear, then grapple onto one and perform a plunging Deathblow on a target—ideally one near the center of the group. This move causes Sekiro to spin the enemy around, dealing significant damage to surrounding foes. Repeat this process until all the dragons are defeated.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Phase 2</h3>

        <p>
          In the second phase, the player finally confronts the Divine Dragon. Directly attacking it is not an option—approaching too closely will trigger a powerful gust of wind that sends the player flying back.
        </p>

        <p>
          To deal damage, the player must run toward the trees infused with electricity, easily identified by their yellow sparkles. Grapple onto one of these trees to be launched high into the air. While airborne, press the attack button (R1/RB/LMB) to strike the Divine Dragon with a lightning-infused spear. Repeat this process, but avoid grabbing the lightning during moments when the dragon blows Sekiro back—doing so will likely result in severe or fatal damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Divine Dragon uses only two main attacks: a vertical slam, which can be easily dodged by running sideways or blocked, and a perilous low sweeping strike that must be jumped over. Both moves have extended range due to the shockwaves they release. The safest strategy is to hold the dodge button to sprint away from danger and to jump when the sweep attack is incoming.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the Divine Dragon’s health is nearly depleted, the electric trees will disappear, forcing the player to survive for about 60 seconds until they reappear. During this time, maintain a safe distance by deflecting, jumping, running, and avoiding all of the Divine Dragon’s aggressive attacks. Once a lightning-charged tree reappears, grapple to it and strike the dragon one last time; Sekiro will be launched directly above the dragon, allowing the player to close in and deliver the finishing Deathblow.
        </p>
