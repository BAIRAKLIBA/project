        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          Isshin Ashina was the founder and leader of the Ashina clan, a powerful warlord determined to protect his homeland from invading forces. As the clan’s strongest warrior, Isshin was renowned for his unmatched swordsmanship and tactical genius. Despite his efforts, the Ashina clan faced decline and eventual downfall.
        </p>

        <p>
          In his later years, Isshin became a symbol of honor and resilience, fighting to uphold the legacy of his clan. His mastery over both traditional sword techniques and lightning-fast attacks made him a fearsome opponent. When you face him in Sekiro, you battle not only his skill but also the weight of his legacy and the desperation of a fading dynasty.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>&#183; <strong>Dragon Flash:</strong> 
          Isshin sheathes his sword and assumes a ready stance. A gleam appears on the hilt. After a brief pause, he swings his sword downward, sending a wave of force forward. Shortly after, a second wave of force follows along the same path.
        </p>

        <p>
          &#183; <strong>Ashina Cross:</strong> 
          Isshin sheaths his sword and, after a brief pause, steps forward toward the player, delivering two rapid slashes.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Ashina Cross Cancel:</strong> If the player is standing very close when Isshin prepares the "Ashina Cross" attack, he will cancel it by swiftly striking the player with his sword, then immediately follow up with a dangerous sweeping attack. He also uses this move after the player deflects his attacks multiple times.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Ichimonji Double:</strong> 
          Isshin raises his blade into a ready stance and executes the Ichimonji double strike. If the player deflects the first hit, Isshin will stagger briefly before instantly following up with the "Charged Attack, Vertical Force Wave."
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Distance Slash:</strong> 
          If the player is at a distance from Isshin or uses an item, Isshin will swiftly dash toward them and deliver a slash. 
        </p>
        
        <p>&#183; <strong>Charged Attack, Horizontal Force Wave:</strong> 
          Isshin sheaths his sword and begins charging an attack. After a brief pause, he rapidly swings his sword in a spinning motion, creating a large circular force wave around him—an attack that is relatively rare.
        </p>


        <h3>Phase 2</h3>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Charge Attack, Double Projected Force.:</strong> 
          Isshin sheaths his sword and prepares to strike. After a brief pause, he performs two slashes toward the player, each releasing a disc-shaped wave of force.
        </p>
        
        <p>&#183; <strong>Leaping Slam:</strong> 
          When at a distance or if the player uses an item, Isshin will leap into the air and slam his spear down. He then follows up with either a sword strike or pulls out his gun to shoot.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Retreating Sweep:</strong> 
          Isshin jumps backward into the air and sweeps his spear forward. He typically performs this move after successfully blocking or deflecting multiple player attacks.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Quad Shot:</strong> 
          When at range, Isshin draws his pistol and fires several shots at the player, often followed by a powerful spear thrust.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 3</h3>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Lightning Slash:</strong> 
          He leaps into the air as lightning gathers around him, then unleashes the electricity toward the player with a sword slash.
