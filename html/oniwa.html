        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          Gyoubu was taken in as an Ashina warrior after his group of infamous bandits were defeated by Isshin. He eventually became Genichiro's most trusted retainer.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The spear he uses against Sekiro was previously owned by the samurai Shuzen Tamura, who Isshin defeats in battle during the game's opening cutscene. Isshin gifted the spear to Gyoubu after his horn-spear broke during the rebellion.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's possible he is one of the Seven Ashina Spears, as he is a high-ranking warrior and uses a unique spear in battle.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1/2</h3>
        <p>&#183; <strong>Standard Combo (Overhead, Downward Slash, Long Overhead):</strong> 
          This combo frequently occurs when you stay close. The first attack is easy to deflect, while the second is quick and can be deflected but is often better blocked. The final overhead strike is also easy to deflect, and successfully deflecting it will stagger Gyuobu.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Charging Ground Sweep:</strong> Gyoubu charges in a circular motion, dragging his spear along the ground. This dangerous attack cannot be blocked, so the best option is to jump over it. It often begins suddenly, catching players off guard. While it most frequently follows his "triple hit charge," it can occur at any moment. This move can also be countered with a grapple.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Figure Eight Charge:</strong> Gyoubu will charge towards you, spinning his spear in a figure of eight pattern. Can be deflected, but is hard to judge.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Triple Hit Charge:</strong> 
          Gyoubu charges forward with his spear aligned alongside his horse, striking three times. This attack is somewhat challenging to deflect. Blocking it may cause your posture to break, but since Gyoubu seldom takes advantage of this, blocking remains a viable strategy.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Detaching Sweep:</strong> 
          Gyoubu uses this move when he is at a distance from the player. He detaches the tip of his spear and swings it in a wide circle three times, using a rope to control it. This attack can be both blocked and deflected. Unlike most ranged attacks in Sekiro, successfully deflecting this move will damage Gyoubu’s posture. Additionally, Gyoubu can be grappled while performing this attack.
        </p>
        
        <p>&#183; <strong>Late Charge:</strong> 
          This attack can be difficult to anticipate at first, but once you recognize the pattern, it becomes easy to deflect. Gyoubu charges toward you with his spear held upright, appearing to simply circle around. He then charges just past you before flicking his spear backward to strike you once.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Concealed Flick:</strong> 
          If you position yourself on Gyoubu’s right side, he might perform an upward flick of his spear that resembles the beginning of his charge sweep. This attack is difficult to predict and often follows if you’ve successfully interrupted his regular combo. After executing this move, he typically charges away and follows up with either a stationary or charging sweep, so be prepared to sprint and grapple for quick counterattacks.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Jumping Attack:</strong> 
          The horse jumps straight up into the air while Gyoubu brings his spear down as it lands. He performs this move twice in a row. Although it might seem natural to dodge, standing your ground and deflecting the spear strikes will inflict significant posture damage on him.
