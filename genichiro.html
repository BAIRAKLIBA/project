        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          The item Remnant: Genichiro suggests that Genichiro was probably born into a humble peasant family during Isshin Ashina’s uprising. Following his mother’s death, he was taken in by the Ashina clan. Over time, he rose through the ranks to become a highly regarded leader and formidable swordsman. Yet, in his determination to save his homeland, he turned to forbidden techniques, becoming deeply fixated on mastering these “heretical arts.”

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>&#183; <strong>Charged Shot:</strong> If left idle, Genichiro will almost always try to interrupt your healing with a powerful bow shot. He may also use a Charged Arrow following a Back Kick, though this move is heavily telegraphed and easy to sidestep. To heal safely, it’s best to create distance before using any recovery items.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Multiple Arrow Jump:</strong> Genichiro releases four arrows while airborne: three rapid shots followed by a delayed fourth. The entire sequence can be blocked. He typically performs this move after retreating backward from an incoming attack.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Floating Passage:</strong> Genichiro executes the Floating Passage Art. After Genichiro perfectly parries Sekiro, he will begin a long string of sword attacks concluding with the Floating Passage. It is advised to only attempt to block or deflect his attacks while at high posture. 
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 2 (Way of Tomoe)</h3>
        <p><strong>&#183; Leaping Slam into Slash:</strong> After taking damage, Genichiro leaps into the air and performs a sword slam. This move can be sidestepped, leaving him open to a few hits. If you parry the slam, he follows up with a horizontal slash — not a Sweep attack, so it can be deflected. Successfully deflecting this slash leads to a final thrust, which can be countered with Mikiri. 
        </p>

        <p> <strong>&#183; Electric slash:</strong> After being hit, Genichiro jumps into the air and comes down with a sword slam. This attack can be sidestepped, giving you a chance to land a few hits. If the slam is parried, he transitions into a horizontal slash, which isn’t a Sweep and can be deflected. Deflecting this sets up his final move—a thrust that can be countered with Mikiri.
