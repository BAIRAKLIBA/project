        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Shinobi Owl is a legendary shinobi and the adoptive father of Sekiro (Wolf). He is a cunning and ruthless figure who trained Sekiro in the ways of the shinobi but later betrayed him by selling him to the Ashina clan. Known for his mastery of various combat styles, including shinobi techniques and swordsmanship, Owl embodies the harsh, unforgiving nature of the shinobi world.
        </p>

        <p>
          His primary motivation is power and control, and he seeks to exploit Sekiro's unique abilities for his own ends. Throughout the game, Owl tests Sekiro's loyalty and skills, challenging him in a brutal duel that reveals the depth of their complex relationship—father, mentor, and betrayer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Owl's fighting style combines traditional samurai swordplay with stealthy shinobi tactics, making him a deadly and unpredictable opponent. His presence emphasizes themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the heavy cost of power in Sekiro's journey.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>&#183; <strong>Shinobi Charm:</strong> 
          Owl throws a charm into the air, which creates a green mist when it lands. While the mist doesn’t deal direct damage, if the player comes into contact with it, they’ll be unable to use healing items (such as the Healing Gourd or Pellets) for 30 seconds. Owl commonly uses this move to finish his attack combos.
        </p>

        <p>
          &#183; <strong>Backflip:</strong> 
          He leaps away from you and hurls shuriken in your direction. Parry both the initial strike and the incoming shuriken.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Running Slash:</strong> He leaps away from you and hurls shuriken in your direction. Parry both the initial strike and the incoming shuriken.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>4-slash Combo:</strong> 
          Owl performs 4 consecutive slashes with his sword. This attack is often followed by a Shinobi Charm.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Shuriken Throw & Flip:</strong> 
          Owl throws two shuriken before flipping through the air toward you, finishing the move with a single downward slash of his sword.
        </p>
        
        <p>&#183; <strong>Charged Attack, Horizontal Force Wave:</strong> 
          Isshin sheaths his sword and begins charging an attack. After a brief pause, he rapidly swings his sword in a spinning motion, creating a large circular force wave around him—an attack that is relatively rare.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Concealed Flick:</strong> 
          If you position yourself on Gyoubu’s right side, he might perform an upward flick of his spear that resembles the beginning of his charge sweep. This attack is difficult to predict and often follows if you’ve successfully interrupted his regular combo. After executing this move, he typically charges away and follows up with either a stationary or charging sweep, so be prepared to sprint and grapple for quick counterattacks.
        </p>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Firecracker:</strong> 
          At times, he will toss black gunpowder that detonates similarly to the Shinobi Firecracker, dealing damage upon explosion.
        </p>


        <h3>Phase 2</h3>

        <p>&#183; <strong>Poisonous Backflip</strong> 
          Similar to phase one, but this time he throws poison. Stay clear of the affected area and keep some antidote ready.
        </p>
