          The Folding Screen Monkeys, and the Hall of Illusions itself, serve to protect the Divine Child of Rejuvenation, as explained by the item: Memory: Screen Monkeys.

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>
          As soon as you spawn, quickly turn around and attack to reveal the Shizaru from its invisibility. If you miss, use the Illusive Hall Bell again to reset all the monkeys’ positions. Taking out Shizaru first makes the fight easier, as otherwise you’ll have to chase the invisible monkey while being pursued by monkey apparitions.
        </p>

        <p>
          After defeating Shizaru, ring the Illusive Hall Bell once more to reset the area. Quickly dash to one of the two Folding Screens ahead to hide from Iwazaru, the orange monkey. When the enemy alert icon fades, wait for Iwazaru to start moving to the right. Then, rush toward the temple and grapple onto the roof above the Illusory Hall Monk. From there, attack and eliminate Iwazaru from behind as it moves right.
        </p>

        <p>
          After defeating Shizaru, move to the left rooftop and then forward. Make sure Mizaru, the purple monkey, spots you and starts running. Chase it as it enters the hall at the back and leaps up into the dark area. After grappling twice, immediately enter stealth within the shadows. Although Mizaru is facing your direction, it can’t see you because of the darkness—circle around it quietly and take it down.
        </p>

        <p>
          If only Kikazaru, the "Hear No Evil" monkey, remains and has been left undisturbed until now, it should be perched on the tree at the center. Approach the tree from the ledge in the middle of the rooftop at the back, then grapple towards it. This will cause Kikazaru to jump away in the opposite direction toward the monk. If it doesn’t, it will leap toward the central grapple point on the roof behind the tree. If the monkey isn’t on the tree or you fail to make it land near the monk, locate it and chase it in a loop until it returns to the tree.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this stage, you should be positioned on the tree while Kikazaru is in the hallway with the monk. Turn left and grapple to the left hallway, then enter the room and move toward the monkey. Kikazaru will notice and flee toward the room with the waterfall, which muffles sound. From there, you can either sneak up on him when he’s not looking from either hallway on the sides or grapple up and leap down on him from the rooftop.
        </p>

        <p>
          After defeating the last monkey, the "SHINOBI EXECUTION" screen will appear. Keep in mind that once you kill the first monkey, monkey apparitions will continuously attack you for the remainder of the fight. All the steps described above must be completed while enduring these ongoing attacks.
